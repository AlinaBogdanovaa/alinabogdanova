Hi there! I'm a Junior QA Engineer with a solid background in client management and technical documentation. Currently transitioning into the IT industry, actively learning and practicing manual testing through personal projects, courses, and simulations.

---

### ✨ About me
I have strong analytical and communication skills that help me grow as a future QA engineer. I used to work as a head of a department responsible for reviewing and approving technical documentation for water supply network reconstruction. This job required attention to detail, working with regulations, and communication with different teams and organizations. Later, I worked as a client manager, where I helped improve the service process and solved customer requests.

Now I’m learning and practicing in software testing.  I don’t have commercial testing experience yet, but *I’m highly motivated and ready to learn more* in a real team. I want to apply my past experience and grow in the field of software quality.
