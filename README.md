#### Hi there! 👋 <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0MYt5jPR6QX5pnqM/giphy.gif" width="50" />
 I'm Alina - Junior QA Engineer. Currently transitioning into the IT industry, actively learning and practicing manual testing through personal projects, courses, and simulations.

---

#### ✨ About me
I have strong analytical and communication skills that help me grow as a future QA engineer. I used to work as a head of a department responsible for reviewing and approving technical documentation for water supply network reconstruction. This job required attention to detail, working with regulations, and communication with different teams and organizations. Later, I worked as a client manager, where I helped improve the service process and solved customer requests.

Now I’m seeking a challenging role as a software tester. Although I haven't had commercial testing experience yet, but **I’m highly motivated and ready to learn more** in a real team. I want to apply my past experience and grow in the field of software quality.
